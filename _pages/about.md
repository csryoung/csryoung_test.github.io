I'm a first year PhD student from [Data Science and Analytics Thrust](https://dsa.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), [Information Hub](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/information-hub/), [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/).
My current research interest lies in LLM4SE, especially on LLM for code efficiency, and OSS.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zishuo Ding](https://personal.hkust-gz.edu.cn/ding/).
