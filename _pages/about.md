I'm a first year PhD student from [Data Science and Analytics Thrust](https://dsa.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), [Information Hub](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/information-hub/), [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/).
My current research interest lies in LLM4SE, particularly LLMs for code efficiency, and OSS. 
Collaborations and discussions in this domain are welcomed.

I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zishuo Ding](https://personal.hkust-gz.edu.cn/ding/). 
Previously, I earned my MPhil from CUHK-Shenzhen where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Pinjia He](https://pinjiahe.github.io/) at the [School of Data Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/).
